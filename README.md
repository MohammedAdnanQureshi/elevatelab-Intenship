# elevatelab-Intenship - TASK-1

The dataset TASK-1.xlsx was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values were identified and filled or removed, duplicates were eliminated, and text data was standardized for consistency. Dates were converted to a uniform format, headers were renamed, and numeric/text data types were corrected. The final cleaned dataset was saved as cleaned_data.xlsx and is ready for analysis.
